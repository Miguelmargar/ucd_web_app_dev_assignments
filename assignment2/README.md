# Project's Name

This page is aimed to allow the user to search through the winners of any nobel prize category and/ or country of birth from 1901 to 2018. Additionally the user may narrow his/her search by male or female winners.

## UX and Features

The viewer will land on the main page and will imediately be able to see a brief description of the page in white letters to the left of the page while the center of the page is decorated with a nobel prize winner coin image.

Directly below this the search fields of years(from and to) are displayed with category and country. Once the user has selected the search button is below the search fields. Once the button is pressed with the correct dates having been input the winners matching the criteria appear below. The options to narrow the search to male or female only also appear below the main search fields and the initial search. 

Each of the winners displayed has a button which if pressed displays further information of the winner in question.
