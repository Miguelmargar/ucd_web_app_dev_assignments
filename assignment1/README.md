# Project's Name

This page is aimed to give the viewer a high level view of myself. It has general information about me such as my education background or work experience. This webpage has 5 main sections: Home, Education, Work Experience, Contact Details and interests.

## UX and Features

The viewer will land on the main page and will imediately be able to see a photo of me. The navbar in the top displays the different sections with the current page being differinciated in the navbar with a different coloured background compared to the rest of the navbar. The navbar is repeated at the bottom of the page in the footer side so as to facilitate navigation if the viewer finds him/herself at the lower end of a page.

The education tab - it provides two videos (included by means of an iframe link to youtube.com) of two institutions where I underwent education. Alongside the videos two tables display the main set of results from the two institutions showcased in the videos

The work experience page displays the last three companies where I worked. This is achieved by displaying the logos of the companies on top of a list for each company listing the main responsabilities/tasks that defined my experience in each company. The name of the companies and the dates describing the periods of time that I worked in each company are displayed above the logos. 

The contact details page simply displays my main contact details for the viewer to be able to contact me while at the bottom of the page a form has been added for the viewer to message me directly(the form is not functional and has been included for design purposes only).

The interests page is mainly a gallery depicting my main interests with an image related to the theme of the interest. The gallery images become opache when the mouse pointer hovers over the images.
